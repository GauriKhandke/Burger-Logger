# Technology :

**1. [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)** : 
* MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
* A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.
* SQL is used by language programmers to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database.

**2. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)** :

* Web Applications : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

* Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.

**3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** : 

* Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 

* A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 

* Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

**4. [Handlebars.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars)** :

* Fast execution: Handlebars compiles templates into JavaScript functions. This makes the template execution faster than most other template engines.

* Mustache-compatible: Handlebars is largely compatible with Mustache templates. In most cases it is possible to swap out Mustache with Handlebars and continue using your current templates.

* Semantic templates: Handlebars provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively.

# Usage :

1. 'Eat-Da-Burger!' is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

2. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

3. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page as 'Devoured'.

4. App will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


# Features :

1. Followed MVC(Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

2. Used Node and MySQL to query and route data.

3. Used handlebars.js to generate HTML pages.

4. App will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
